# Food Search
> Practicing using React Native and API. I used the Yelp Api to build this app that allows the user to do a search for food in their local area. 
This app is is not configured to use the actual user's location. It is a sample project and is only set to use Monterey, CA. 

## General info
This is a learning project. I was more interested in getting the API to work properly as that was the sole function of the application. 

## Running the project

- Clone this project
```
git clone < project-url.git >
```
- Install the dependencies 
```
npm install
```
- Run on emulator 
```
react-native run-ios
```

### Android steps

- Launch a virtual android device [(through *Android Studio* for instance)](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html#viewing)

> If you have never installed any android virtual device, [follow those instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html#createavd)

- Then, run the project in executing on your project folder:

```
react-native run-android
```
